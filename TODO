* Block diagram of funtional units, switches, pumps and valves in machine.

* Determine different cleaning cycles
  - Add default firmware cycles to this firmware flush handling. 

* Improve load cell readings with averages and calibration
  - Moved to average and median reading. Still needs work and drifts.

* Build state machine for various brew cycles. 
  - Done apart from grinding.

* Determine exit and error condtions from different cycles - water not hot enough, etc.
  - In progress

* Formalize the API that I made.
* Add basic manual control to app. 
  - In progress

* Consider programmability.

* Document how the grinding is done in existing firmware 
  - In progress

Open questions:

* Does the heater work on the recirculation too?  There's implication of a thermal exchange in the patent. 
* Can we reduce grinding noise by adjusting the shaker speeds?


Done
