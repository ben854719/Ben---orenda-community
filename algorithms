Heater off
Pumps 1, 2, 3 off
Recircute off

Issues
 - We don't necessarily know how much liquid is in the brew chamber 
 - 1st and 2nd pumps can fill brew chamber faster than 3rd can empty, although we
   can run 2nd pump slower
 - You might need a large container 
 - Do we need to empty recirculation? Probably not. 
 - Need user exit/stop condition, like button press
 - Water meter in hidden chamber is high at 430 of 475ml.  
 
Start:

  Consider current strain gauge reading as lowest
  Disable recirculation 
  Disable 1st and second pumps 
  Start 3rd pump

Loop:
  If water level in reservoir is empty and the strain gauge is no longer decreasing exit 

  If the water level marker is true, that means there's water in the chamber and 
  may be water in the reservoir. 
    Run pump 1 until marker is false
  Otherwise
    There might be some water in chambers and some in reservoir.  
    Run pump 1 for up to 40 seconds to get a read. 
    If it never gets a positive, don't run again. 
    
  Run pump (subject to logic below) for at least 35 seconds after we have a positive
  water level read.  Adjust this according to speed of pumping.  Once this expires, don't run pump 2 again unless water level goes positve again. 
  
  
  Wait two seconds 
  Take strain gauge reading 

  if water level is not empty 
    If reading is lower
      Start pump 2 (subject to above)
    else if reading is similar 
      Leave running 
    else // Water level increasing
      Stop pumps 2
  else
    stop pump 2
  endif

Power off



Grinding 
--------

Start:
  Consider time depending upon strength of coffee and amount of brew
  Start top and bottom shakers 
  Start grinder
  Wait some time 
  Stop grinder and top shaker
  Wait some final amount of time for bottom shaker to get grounds


Brewing 
-------
  
Assumptions: 
brew chamber clean and empty

Notes: 

Consider LED operation during this time 
For cold brew, no heating 
Option to use own grounds, no grinding

Brewing: 
  Tare brew chamber 
  Enough water? No, user error 
  Grinding if part of recipe 
  Meanwhile, start pump 1 and heater to heat water in reservoir to   desired temperature - note these can run at the same time 
  
Heating:
  Continue to run heating 
  Monitor temperature in reservoir
  If not increasing within a certain time -> exit user error 
  If not desired temperature, continue with Heating
  Heater off
  
Mixing:  
  Switch to recirculation. 
  Start pump 2 until strain gauge has correct amount of liquid
  If this isn't achieved -> exit user error
  
Recirculation:  
  Stop pump 2
  Start pump 3 for recirculation   
  Continue reciculation until correct temperature and strength is achieved. 
  Not archived in time? -> exit user error
  
Dispense:  
 Switch to dispense from reciculation
 Continue to run pump 3 until back to tare (or close, wet coffee grounds)
